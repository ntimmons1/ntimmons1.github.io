            Now, let's animate those squares. This is very similar to box 2, except
            that we'll create an animation loop to move the squares.
        </p>
        <div>
                <canvas id="canvas3" width="150px" height="100px" ></canvas>
                <svg id="svg3" width="150px" height="100px" ></svg>
        </div>
        <p>
            Have a look at the JavaScript for this box, especially the <code>onTick</code>
            function that moves things (remember animation loops from Workbook 1?).
        </p>
        <p>
            This example hopefully highlights the difference between the <em>immediate</em> mode
            API (Canvas) and the <em>retained</em> mode API (SVG).
            In retained mode, the primitives (in this case the square) are
            represented as data. To move them, we change the data structure.
            In immediate mode, the primitives are drawn - they are only represented
            in the code. To animate things, we need to erase the picture and re-draw
            the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some ways, immediate mode is easier: we draw what we want, when we
            want. We can use whatever data structures we want to represent things.
            In other ways, retained mode is easier: we can create objects, and then
            alter them as needed.
