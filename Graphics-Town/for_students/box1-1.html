            Web pages are made up of elements - like paragraphs, headings, and buttons.
            To do graphics, we make special elements that give us a rectangular region that
            we can draw in.
            For the Canvas API (and actually some other APIs), we create "canvas" elements
            using the "canvas" tag.
            For SVGs, we create "svg" elements using the SVG tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here we made one of each, side by side (look at the HTML source in <code>for_students/box1-1.html</code>):
            <div>
                <canvas id="canvas1" width="150px" height="100px" style="border:2px solid #F00"></canvas>
                <svg id="svg1" width="150px" height="100px" style="border:2px solid #F00"></svg>
            </div>
            Note that these are normal HTML elements. We can give them ids (and classes),
            as well as styling them (here they have red borders).
            In fact, we can use CSS to style them - if you look at the style sheet this and the other HTML files on this page use
            <code>for_students/a02.css</code>, you will see that all of the other ones have a thin black border.
        </p>
        <p>
            By themselves, these elements are pretty boring - we need to write some
            JavaScript to make them more interesting.
            SVGs will have an alternative, but we'll get to that later.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may not be obvious in these examples, but in both SVG and Canvas,
            Y is measured downwards - this is different than you might be
            used to. We'll come back to talk about this later.
        </p>
    </div>
