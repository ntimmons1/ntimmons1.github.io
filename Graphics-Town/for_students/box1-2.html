            Now I am going to use those same boxes, but draw in them.
            The HTML is basically the same as box 1 (except that the style comes from CSS).
            The difference is that the JavaScript is going to add a rectangle to each.
            Be sure to go look at the JavaScript in <code>for_students/page1.js</code>, which gets loaded at the end of the HTML file.
        </p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="canvas2" width="150px" height="100px" ></canvas>
            <svg id="svg2" width="150px" height="100px" ></svg>
        </div>
        <p>
            We will learn about the detail of how each of those work later,
            but observe the key difference when you look at the code.
            In Canvas, we use the "fill" command to fill in the pixels of the
            rectangle, while in SVG we create a "rect" element and add it to
            the SVG element.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this simple example, things don't seem too different.
