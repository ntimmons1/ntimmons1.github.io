<h1 id="page-5-try-canvas-programming">Page 5: Try Canvas Programming</h1>

<p>This workbook has two programming exercises.</p>

<p>The first one is required. Completing it correctly is part of
completing the workbook.</p>

<p>The second one is optional. Doing it correctly gets you bonus points.
You cannot get bonus points for exercise 2 if you don&rsquo;t have a solution
to exercise 1.</p>

<p>You should do these exercises by editing the file <code>for_students/page5.js</code>.
We&rsquo;ve actually started things for you.
Specifically, your code for exercise 1 should go into the function
<code>wb2_pg5_ex1</code>, and your code for exercise 2 should go into the function
<code>wb2_pg5_ex2</code>. Please put all of your code inside of these functions!</p>

<h2 id="exercise-1-canvas-event-programming">Exercise 1: Canvas Event Programming</h2>

<p>In the Canvas element box (with id <code>ex1canvas</code>), please implement the following behavior:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When the user clicks in the element, a circle appears under the mouse.
Circles get added, so the user can make lots of circles.</p></li>

<li><p>If a circle is under the mouse, it changes color.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of your code for this exercise should go into the function <code>wb2_pg5_ex1</code>
in the file <code>for_students/page5.js</code>.
We&rsquo;ve started things for you.</p>

<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The examples on page 4 should give you lots of ideas. Those did rectangles, not circles. But a lot of other things are the same.</li>
<li>You will need to keep a list of circles, so you can check if the mouse is inside of them</li>
<li>You can do this in a purely event driven style (using <code>onclick</code> and <code>onmousemove</code>) or with an animation loop</li>
<li>You can make the circles all the same size (pick a radius - like 10 pixels)</li>
<li>You can decide if the mouse is over a circle by checking to see if the distance between the mouse and the center of the circle is less than the circle&rsquo;s radius</li>
<li>Making the behavior correct at the edge of the box is hard, since you may not get <code>mousemove</code> events when the mouse is outside the box</li>
<li>Get part 1 to work first (making circles on click). Then get part 2 to work.</li>
<li>Getting the mouse position relative to the element requires knowing where the element is. Read the example code on page 4 to see a way to do this.</li>
</ul>

<p><style>
    canvas {
        border-style: solid;
        border-width: 2px;
    }
    svg {
        border-style: solid;
        border-width: 2px;
    }
</style>
<script src="/for_students/page5.js" type="module"></script>
<canvas id="ex1canvas" height="400px" width="400px">&lt;/canvas</p>

<h2 id="exercise-2-fireworks">Exercise 2: Fireworks</h2>

<p>This is a <em>bonus</em> exercise: if you do it correctly, you will get bonus
points. But don&rsquo;t try it until you get exercise 1 working.</p>

<p>And put all your code into the function <code>wb2_pg5_ex2</code>.</p>

<p>Your job is to make something that looks like simple fireworks.</p>

<ol>
<li>When the user clicks the mouse in the rectangle, a circle starts at the bottom edge of the screen and travels to the mouse position.</li>
<li>When the circle gets to the position of the click, it changes to a bunch of small squares that start moving outward from that position. They move until they get to the edge of the screen (or they can &ldquo;fade out&rdquo;) after a while.</li>
<li>You need to be able to have multiple fireworks happening at the same time (the user should be able to click to shoot a new one before the first one is done).</li>
</ol>

<p>You can start simple and add extra, more complex things:</p>

<ul>
<li>have the circles start at random locations on the ground (but make sure they &ldquo;explode&rdquo; at the mouse positions)</li>
<li>add some random fireworks in addition to the ones created by clicks</li>
<li>randomize the colors (so each firework is a different color)</li>
<li>make things follow projectile motion (have downward acceleration due to gravity)</li>
<li>or other creative things (although, the &ldquo;shooting at the mouse position and having it explode there&rdquo; is a requirement)</li>
</ul>

<p>Roughly, you will get 1 bonus point for #1 (shooting circles to specific locations), 1 bonus point for #2 (having them &ldquo;explode&rdquo; at that location), and 1 additional bonus point for extra features or additional creativity (see above list for ideas).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the main programming part for this week, however, on <a href="/docs/six/">page 6</a> we
have one last detail to discuss.</p>
