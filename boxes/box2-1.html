        <p>You can put JavaScript code right into your HTML.</p>
        <p>
        For example, I can use a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and just
        put JavaScript right in the middle of a paragraph like this one.
        <script>
            // this is JavaScript code
            // I will do something silly
            let boxname = "Box 1";
            let message = boxname + "'s initial message to the console";
            console.log(message)
        </script>
        Look into the HTML to find that JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should have noticed that snippet of JavaScript used the function
            <code>console.log</code> to write a message to the console.
            This is a good time to make sure that you know about the console!
            Open the console of your web browser, and make sure that you see
            the message. (It will say <em>Box 1's initial message to the console</em>).
            To open the console in Chrome and Firefox on Windows machines it's typically CTRL-SHIFT-I (the letter I).
            If you're using Visual Studio Code with connected debugging,
            you can see the console right in a VSCode window.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also stick JavaScript code right into elements that use them.
            Here, I'll put a button right into this paragraph and attach some JavaScript
            to it.
            <button onclick="console.log('Button 1 Pressed!');">Button 1</button>
            You should look at the HTML to see the JavaScript right inline on the button.
            You should see what the button does (get used to looking at the console!).
        </p>
        <p>
            While you can stick JavaScript code right into HTML, you generally, should not do it.
            For little one liners, it might be OK.
            But, for anything more complicated, having the JavaScript in a separate file
            makes things much easier to keep track of.
