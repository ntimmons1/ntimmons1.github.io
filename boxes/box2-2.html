            If we're not supposed to put JavaScript into the HTML files, the next
            question is where to put it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will put JavaScript programs into separate files - dividing them up into
            smaller chunks (roughly "modules"), but that will come later.
            By convention, I will always name my JavaScript files with ".js", although
            other people will do other things (for example, we might name the files
            with ".es6" to signify that we're using the ES6 version of JavaScript).
        </p>
        <p>
            We load JavaScript files into our HTML page using the same
            <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that we used in Box 1. Except that
            rather than putting the code inline, the tag gives the file name
            to load. Look at the HTML, it's right in this paragraph.
            <script src="two.js" type="module"></script>
            You will also want to look at the file that got loaded ("two.js") and
            check the console (since, like Box 1, the code writes there).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're curious (and you should be) the <code>type="module"</code>
            in the tag tells the browser that we want the ES6 version of JavaScript.
        </p>
    </div>
