            The "blinking" in Box 7 of page three is really annoying. Instead let's make
            something a little less annoying: instead of just changing to another color
            in a flash, have the color slowly (but not too slowly) change from white to red,
            then back to white. It should repeat.
        </p>

            <strong>Hint:</strong> A trick here is that HTML likes colors as hex (so red is #FF0000).
            You'll probably want to do your math with regular numbers and convert.

            If you want to try something more challenging, have it fade gradually between a list
            of colors (just like page 3 switched between red, yellow, and green, you could make
            yours slowly fade from red to yellow to green then back to red).
