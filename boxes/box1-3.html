        We can associate styles with particular IDs or classes. 
        This styling information can be placed right into the HTML file.
        If you look inside this "box" in the HTML file (look for <code>boxes/box1-3.html</code>),
        you will see a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, as well as things that use it.
    </p>
    <style>
        .redText {
            color:darkred;
        }
    </style>
    <p>
        The style information (look in the HTML file!) says that anything with a 
        "redText" class should be dark red. 
        <span class="redText">Like this span.</span>
        Styles allow us to make a lot of things that share properties, like
        <span class="redText">these words</span> and 
        this <span class="redText">word</span> as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're looking at this HTML in Visual Studio Code (or some other IDEs),
        when you read it you will see colors and other information shown with the styles.
    </p>
    <p>
        The styles are written in a language called CSS. Usually, we do not put CSS 
        right into our HTML, we put them into separate files (.CSS files) and we link
        to those style sheets using an html "link" tag. At the top of this file, there
        is a link to the CS559 style sheet that is used for all pages in this workbook. 
        This example box links to a special style sheet just for this page.
    </p>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="one.css">
    <p>
        See if you can figure out why 
        <span class="blueText">this text has one color</span>, 
        but,
        <span id="blueText">this text has another color!</span>
        You should be able to change the colors by editing the style sheet file.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use style sheets to change the appearance of things besides text.
        In the "one.css" style sheet, there's a definition for the box below. 
        Try to experiment with it to change how it looks.
    </p>
    <div class="onebox">
        This is a first box.
    </div>
    <div class="onebox">
        This is a second box.
    </div>
</div>
