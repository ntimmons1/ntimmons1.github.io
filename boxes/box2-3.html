            A cool thing about the web browser is that many things are asynchronous.
            You don't have to wait for one thing to finish before starting the next.
            So, for example, when we load a JavaScript program, we don't know when
            it will finish loading. It could load immediately, or it could take some
            time (if it has to be fetched over the network, or the compiler takes some
            time). This creates a potential problem: we want our JavaScript program
            to access our web page, but we don't know if the web page has finished
            loaded (and is ready to be accessed) when our program is run.
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer to this will be to delay running our JavaScript program until
            after we're sure that the web page is loaded.
            To do this, we'll put our program (the place to go when we want to "start")
            as a function, and set this function to be called after the window finishes
            loading. Inside the HTML file for this paragraph, you'll see an example.
            It's inside the script tag (remember you are supposed to read this!).
        </p>
        <script>
            function main() {
                console.log("Box 3: written after the window loads");
            }
             window.onload = main;
             console.log("Box 3: written during loading");
        </script>
        <p>
            Notice how I defined a function (called <code>main</code>, that prints something),
            and then assigned
            this function to the <code>onload</code> member of the <code>window</code> object.
            If you look in the console, you'll see that print statement occurs
            <em>after</em> all of the stuff that gets run during the loading (like the other
            <code>console.log</code> statement).
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure that you're comfortable to the idea of defining functions (like we did here)
            and treating them as objects (such as assigning them to variables to be called later).
