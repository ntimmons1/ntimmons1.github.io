            JavaScript has complete access to the web page. It can read and write to it.
            To make this easier, we need to name parts so we can find them.
            So, we can <span id="box1-span">put text into the HTML that you won't see!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you look at the HTML, you'll see what is in the HTML is not what you
            see on the screen, because the JavaScript code finds the text and changes it.
            The initial text (in the HTML file) appeared, but it was changed so fast
            that you never got to see it. This might be a good excuse to practice with
            the debugger again: stop the program before the statement that changes the text,
            and you'll see what the page was like before - then step and see how it gets
            changed.
