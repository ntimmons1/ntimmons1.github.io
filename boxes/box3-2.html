            We saw this on the last page, but when a button is clicked
            it calls the <code>onclick</code> handler.
            More generally, when something happens (to almost any element),
            it creates an event.
            We can tie a function (called a handler) to the event, and do things
            when the event happens.
            In these examples, we will have some buttons, and have the handlers change
            things on the web page.
            Be sure to look at the HTML and JavaScript to see what is going on.
            There is a lot of discussion in the comments

            <button id="box2-button1" class="simplebutton">1</button>
            <button id="box2-button2" class="simplebutton">2</button>
            <button id="box2-button3" class="simplebutton">3</button>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li id="box2-li1">Button 1 was not pressed yet</li>
            <li id="box2-li2">Button 2 was not pressed yet</li>
            <li id="box2-li3">Button 3 was not pressed yet</li>
        </ul>

            An obvious, but important thing here is that our code only gets
            run when an event happens. Otherwise, we don't do anything.
            This is called <em>event-driven</em> programming.

            Different kinds of HTML elements generate different kinds of events.
