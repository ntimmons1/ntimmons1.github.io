            Here is another example.
            Notice how the first slider doesn't need
            to ever create an event. When the second slider
            is updated, it polls the first (looks at its value).
        </p>
        <p>
            Change the first slider to affect how the second one moves.
        </p>
        <p>
            <input type="range" min="-5" max="5" value="1" id="box6-slider1">
            <input type="range" min="0" max="100" id="box6-slider2">
        </p>
        <p>
            Or with a checkbox (buttons are mainly good at generating events):
        </p>
        <p>
            speed: <input type="checkbox" id="box6-check">
            <input type="range" min="0" max="100" id="box6-slider3">
        </p>
        <p>
            Or, even this.... (which isn't that much different)
        </p>
        <p>
            go: <input type="checkbox" id="box6-check2">
            <input type="range" min="0" max="100" id="box6-slider4">
        </p>
        <p>
            The thing to notice here is that the "loop" runs even if
            the slider isn't moving! In this case, it's pretty wasteful.
            But it gets at the main idea of animation loop programming:
            the loop keeps going, and each iteration it checks to see if
            something happened. In contrast, event-loop programming only
            does things when something happens.
