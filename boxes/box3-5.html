            Thus far, we can do things in response to the user.
            Our code runs in response to an event happening.
            This is important in the web browser, because we want the browser to do
            other things, rather than just waiting around for the user to happen.
            Therefore, most web programming is event-based.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what happens if we want things to happen without the user doing anything?
            For example, when we want to animate something (have it move on its own).
        </p>
        <p>
            We might make a loop - having things move each step, over and over until its
            done. This is bad because we have to handle events in the loop or ignore the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, the web paradigm is to use events - but have events that are not tied to
            user actions. Our program requests an event some time in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>RequestAnimationFrame</code> requests an "event" for the next
            screen redraw - it's basically saying "call me in approximately 16ms".
            If something happens every 16 milliseconds, that means it happens 60 times per second, which is a common target rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is now.
            <span id="box5-rs1">This will be changed in the future.</span>
            You probably never saw that change (since it happened a few ms)
            after the document finished loading.
        </p>
        <p>Here we'll chain two of them. <span id="box5-rs2"></span></p>
        <p>
            Note that the timings on those might be weird: the browser might have
            had other work to do (like loading the page), so it might take it a while
            before it generates the event.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's a more typical use of <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>,
            every time we finish one change, we schedule the next. Look at the code.
