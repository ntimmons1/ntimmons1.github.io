        One last HTML element before we move on to programming: sliders. 
        Sliders are mainly useful when we have programs to read them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just like buttons, sliders are elements that could be put anywhere
        <input type="range"> 
        like right in this paragraph. Note that a slider is called a "range"
        input (since it's useful for making a number range).
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, we'll try to put sliders in more useful places.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just like buttons (and most HTML elements), sliders can be styled. 
        They can also have their minimum, maximum, and step sizes set. 
        Here are a few sliders to try.
    </p>
    <div>
        <!-- the "block" display type causes the sliders to stack -->
        <input type="range" style="display: block">
        <input type="range" style="display: block" step="10" min="0" max="100">
        <input type="range" style="display: block; background: #DDD">
        <input type="range" style="display: block; background: #DDD" step="5" min="0" max="20">
    </div>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, handling of slider styling seems inconsistent
        across browsers. The above looks very different in Chrome and Firefox.
        There are all kinds of workarounds on the web - but for class, we won't worry
        about it  - we understand that sliders may be ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sliders are pretty boring without programs that use them.
        We'll make use of sliders soon enough.
    </p>
