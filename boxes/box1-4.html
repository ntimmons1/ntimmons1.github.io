        As you might guess, color is important for doing computer graphics.
        You should read the 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/tutorials/color-initial-answers-to-a-practical-question/">CS559 Color Tutorial</a>.
        It's from the 2015 version of the class and discusses the basics.

        For now, we should focus on what we'll use for HTML.
        When you read the HTML for the boxes on this page, you'll see that many of the colors are specified
        by name (e.g. "red", "blue", "darkred", "blueviolet").
        This is convenient in a web page, but isn't always available when programming.

        You should get used to specifying colors as hex strings like <code>#FF8AC5</code>. 
        This works for HTML, and for a lot of the other web programming we will do. 
        See the 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/tutorials/color-initial-answers-to-a-practical-question/">CS559 Color Tutorial</a>
        for a discussion. 
        But basically read <code>#FF8AC5</code> as 3 hexidecimal numbers (FF,8A,C5) that 
        are the amount of red, green and blue. Each number is a binary fraction, so that FF means 
        FF/FF (or 255/255) or 100% (of red in this case).

        Here are some boxes for you to color:
        <div style="height:20px; width:80px; float:left; margin:5px; background-color: blue"> </div>
        <div style="height:20px; width:80px; float:left; margin:5px; background-color: #FF88CC"> </div>
        <div style="height:20px; width:80px; float:left; margin:5px; background-color: #F8C"> </div>
        <div style="height:20px; width:80px; float:left; margin:5px; background-color: #005080"> </div>
        <br /><br />
        Although, this is a very verbose way to make boxes. 
        Try experimenting with changing their colors.
