               So far, we've made the buttons in HTML and attached JavaScript to them.
               However, we can also make the buttons right in JavaScript using
               JavaScript functions that create HTML elements and place them in the DOM
               (the tree of objects).
           </p>
           <p id="box6par2">
               Here is an example that places a button right in this paragraph.
               Be sure to look at the code and understand the basic ideas.
               Notice how we directly manipulate the "tree" of elements
               (here we add more children to the paragraph).
           </p>
           <script>
               // place buttons within the paragraph
               // remember that we usually will not put code into our HTML
               //
               // first, find the paragraph we're going to add to
                let par06 = document.getElementById("box6par2");
                // now we create the button
                let button06 = document.createElement("button");
                // set it's text to what we want to see
                button06.innerText = "Button6";
                // add the button to the end of the paragraph
                par06.appendChild(button06);
                // Change the class of the button to make it look nicer
                // see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList
                // for info on adding classes to elements
                button06.classList.add("basicbutton");
                // make the button do something
                button06.onclick = function() {
                    console.log("Box 6's button was pressed");
                };

           </script>
           <p id="box6par3">
               Here is another, more complicated example creating multiple buttons
               and using closures to give them some behavior.
               This is a good chance to try to learn to read code that uses closures.
               This time, the actual code is in the "two.js" file.
